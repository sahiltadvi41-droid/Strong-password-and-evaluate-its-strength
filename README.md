# Strong-password-and-evaluate-its-strength
Best practices for creating strong passwords:To create strong passwords, prioritize length, complexity, and uniqueness. Aim for at least 12-16 characters, and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information, common words, or patterns that can be easily guessed. Each account should have its own unique password.
Length: Longer passwords are significantly harder to crack. Aim for at least 12-16 characters, but ideally longer, according to the National Cybersecurity Alliance. 
Complexity: Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 
Uniqueness: Do not reuse passwords across different accounts. 
Avoid Personal Information: Do not include your name, birthday, address, or any other information that could be easily found by others. 
Avoid Common Words and Patterns: Do not use dictionary words, phrases, or keyboard patterns like "qwerty". 
Consider a Passphrase: A memorable phrase, even if longer, can be easier to remember and harder to guess. 
Use a Password Manager: Tools like LastPass or Keeper can help you generate, store, and manage strong, unique passwords, according to Liventus. 
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication: When available, enable MFA (like two-factor authentication) for an extra layer of security. 

Tips learned from the evaluation:Strong passwords are crucial for online security. To create a strong password, aim for at least 12 characters, including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information, dictionary words, or easily guessable patterns. Consider using a password manager to generate and store unique, complex passwords for each account. 

Common password attacks :
1) Bruteforce :A brute force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys. It is a simple yet reliable tactic for gaining unauthorized access to individual accounts and organizations’ systems and networks. The hacker tries multiple usernames and passwords, often using a computer to test a wide range of combinations, until they find the correct login information.
The name "brute force" comes from attackers using excessively forceful attempts to gain access to user accounts. Despite being an old cyberattack method, brute force attacks are tried and tested and remain a popular tactic with hackers.

2) Dictionary:A dictionary attack is a basic form of brute force hacking in which the attacker selects a target, then tests possible passwords against that individual’s username. The attack method itself is not technically considered a brute force attack, but it can play an important role in a bad actor’s password-cracking process. 
The name "dictionary attack" comes from hackers running through dictionaries and amending words with special characters and numbers. This type of attack is typically time-consuming and has a low chance of success compared to newer, more effective attack methods.

How password complexity affects security:Password complexity significantly impacts security by making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to guess or crack passwords. Complex passwords, which include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, increase the number of possible combinations, thus lengthening the time and resources required for a successful brute-force or dictionary attack.
